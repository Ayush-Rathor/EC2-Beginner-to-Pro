Working with AMIs - Notes
---------------------------

Overview:
- AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are used to create EC2 instances, and they can be customized with specific software configurations for various use cases.

What is an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)?
- AMI: A template containing the software configuration needed to launch an EC2 instance (OS, pre-installed software, configuration files).
- Types of AMIs:
  - AWS-provided AMIs
  - Community-contributed AMIs
  - Paid AMIs from AWS Marketplace
  - Custom-built AMIs

AMI Use Cases:
- AMIs are required to launch EC2 instances, and a single AMI can be used to launch multiple identical instances.

---------------------------
Boot Modes for AMIs
---------------------------
- Boot Mode: Defines how the platform initializes the OS during the boot process.
  - UEFI: Modern boot mode used by Graviton instances.
  - Legacy BIOS: Traditional boot mode for Intel and AMD instances.
  - The AMI boot mode is optional, and instances will use the default boot mode if no specific one is set.

---------------------------
Shared and Public AMIs
---------------------------
- Shared AMI: An AMI made available for others to use. It can be modified and reused to create new AMIs.
- Public AMIs: Available for everyone, but caution is needed when using them. It’s important to ensure the AMI comes from a trusted source. Amazon-owned public images are identified as “amazon” in the account field.

Considerations before Sharing AMIs Publicly:
1. Regional Resource: AMIs are region-specific.
2. AMIs That Can’t Be Public: Certain AMIs are restricted from being shared publicly.
3. Sensitive Data: Avoid including sensitive information in AMIs.
4. Deprecation: Public AMIs may become outdated over time.
5. Billing: Public AMIs may have separate billing for usage.

---------------------------
Paid AMIs
---------------------------
- Paid AMIs: Available for purchase on the AWS Marketplace.
  - Billing Structure: Charges for paid AMIs are separate from EC2 instance billing and may include additional taxes.
  - Launch Permissions: AMI owners control the launch permissions, including:
    - Public: Accessible by all AWS accounts.
    - Explicit: Granted to specific AWS accounts or organizations.
    - Implicit: The AMI owner can launch instances from their own AMI.

---------------------------
Gold AMIs
---------------------------
- Gold Image/AMI: A pre-configured AMI that meets internal IT standards (security, compliance, etc.), used as a base for launching multiple identical instances.
- These gold images need to be updated regularly to ensure they remain secure and compliant.

---------------------------
EC2 Image Builder
---------------------------
- EC2 Image Builder helps automate the creation, testing, and deployment of AMIs and container images.
  - Automated Updates: Automatically updates AMIs when new software updates are released.
  - Security & Compliance: Integrates with AWS Organizations and supports sharing AMIs across accounts.
  - No Cost: EC2 Image Builder is free to use.

---------------------------
Considerations for Sharing AMIs Internally
---------------------------
- No Sharing Limits: There are no limits on sharing AMIs internally.
- Copying and Usage: Ensure proper controls for copying and usage of AMIs across accounts.
- Tags, Encryption, and Keys: Proper tagging, encryption, and key management are essential.
- Regional Resources: AMIs are region-specific.
- Billing: Understand the costs when sharing AMIs within an organization.

---------------------------
Next Step
---------------------------
- The next step would be to explore storage options for instances launched with these AMIs.
