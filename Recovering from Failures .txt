Recovering from Failures - Notes

Overview:
- Recovery planning is essential to ensure continuity during service interruptions, disk failures, natural disasters, or unforeseen events.
- How to prepare for and recover from these interruptions must be planned and tested regularly.
- The AWS Shared Responsibility Model defines what AWS is responsible for (infrastructure, hardware, software, networking, and facilities) and what the customer is responsible for (data, application, and backup recovery).

Recovery Options:
- Multiple recovery options exist depending on the needs of the workload.
- Considerations for workloads that don’t require EC2 Auto Scaling or Load Balancers include the type of storage service and recovery options suitable for service level agreements (SLAs).
  
Instance Recovery:
1. Status Checks for EC2 Instances:
   - AWS provides status checks to monitor the health of EC2 instances and determine when intervention is needed.
  
2. Recovering EC2 Instances:
   - If an EC2 instance experiences failure, automatic recovery can be triggered, or manual intervention can be applied based on status checks.
  
3. Simplified Automatic Recovery:
   - Automatic recovery options can be configured for EC2 instances, minimizing downtime and ensuring faster recovery.
  
Backup and Recovery of Instances:
- To recover a fully functional EC2 instance, backup all essential components, including:
  1. EBS Snapshots: Provides point-in-time copies of the data volume.
  2. AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Contains the operating system, software, and configurations of the instance. It’s crucial to update the AMI to include necessary software and patches.
  3. Storage Connections: If using Amazon EFS and S3, document mount points and bucket names for easy recovery.
  
- AWS Backup:
  - Use AWS Backup for a comprehensive backup solution to back up EC2 instances and attached EBS volumes.
  - AWS Backup ensures that not only the data but also the instance parameters (e.g., instance type, VPC, security groups, IAM roles) are captured during backup.
  
- Restoring Instances with AWS Backup:
  - AWS Backup enables you to restore full EC2 instances, including all EBS volumes and parameters, using the console, API, or CLI.
  - The restoration process recreates the instance with the same configuration, ensuring consistency across recovery.
