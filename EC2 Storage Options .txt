Amazon EC2 Storage Options - Notes
---------------------------

Overview:
- Amazon EC2 offers flexible, cost-effective, and easy-to-use data storage options for instances.
- Storage options vary in performance and durability and can be used independently or together, depending on requirements.

---------------------------
Root Device Storage
---------------------------
- The root device volume is where the image used to boot the EC2 instance is stored.
- Two types of root devices:
  - Instance store-backed AMI
  - Amazon EBS-backed AMI
- Root device type is crucial because each has different capabilities for managing data.

---------------------------
Instance Store-backed Instances
---------------------------
- Instance store volumes are temporary storage attached to the instance.
- Data in the instance store persists only during the lifetime of the instance.
- Instance store data is lost in the following cases:
  - The underlying disk drive fails
  - The instance stops or terminates
  - The instance hibernates
- Not suitable for long-term data storage.
- Cannot detach instance store volumes and attach them to a different instance.

---------------------------
Amazon EBS-backed Instances
---------------------------
- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block-level storage for EC2 instances.
- Benefits:
  - Flexible in size, performance, and durability.
  - Can modify EBS volume size and IOPS dynamically without downtime.
  - EBS volumes are persistent; data remains intact even when the instance is stopped or terminated (unless specified otherwise).

---------------------------
Block Device Mapping
---------------------------
- Local storage volumes can be configured via block device mapping during launch.
- These volumes are available for mounting and use, but if the instance fails, or is stopped or terminated, the data is lost.

---------------------------
EBS Volume Types and Considerations
---------------------------
1. Primary Storage:
   - EBS is commonly used for primary storage of instances due to its persistence.
2. Multiple Volume Types:
   - EBS offers several volume types, each optimized for different use cases.
3. Multiple Volumes Per Instance:
   - You can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single instance.
4. Data Availability:
   - EBS provides high data availability and reliability.
5. Data Persistence:
   - Data on EBS persists independently of the instance state.
6. Data Encryption:
   - EBS supports encryption to secure data in transit and at rest.
7. Flexibility:
   - EBS allows you to dynamically adjust the volume size and performance.
8. Snapshots:
   - EBS volumes support snapshots, which are backups of the volume's data.

---------------------------
Boot Times Differences
---------------------------
- Instances launched from EBS-backed AMIs typically boot faster than those from instance store-backed AMIs.
- With EBS, only the necessary boot parts are retrieved during launch, but instance performance may be slower initially while the rest of the data is retrieved.
- When an instance stops and restarts, it launches quickly from the stored EBS volume.

EBS vs Instance Store-backed AMIs
---------------------------
Characteristic         | Amazon EBS-backed AMI                                     | Amazon Instance Store-backed AMI
-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
Boot time              | Usually < 1 minute                                        | Usually < 5 minutes
Root device size limit | 64 TiB                                                    | 10 GiB
Root device volume     | EBS volume                                                | Instance store volume
Data persistence       | Data persists (unless deleted)                            | Data persists only during the instance life
Modifications          | Instance type, kernel, RAM disk, user data can be changed | Fixed for the life of the instance
Charges                | Charged for instance and EBS usage                        | Charged for instance usage and storing AMI in S3
AMI creation           | Single command                                            | Requires AMI tools installation
Stopped state          | Can be stopped while preserving root volume               | Cannot be stopped, instance is either running or terminated

---------------------------
Cloud File Storage Options
---------------------------
- Cloud file storage provides access to data through shared file systems.
- Useful for workloads that require shared access to files across multiple instances.

Types of Cloud File Storage:
1. Amazon S3:
   - Object storage that offers high scalability and durability.
2. Amazon EFS:
   - Managed NFS (Network File System) for scalable file storage.
3. Amazon FSx:
   - Managed Windows File Server or Lustre for high-performance file storage.
