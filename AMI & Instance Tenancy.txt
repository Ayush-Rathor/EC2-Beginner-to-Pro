Introduction to Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)  

------------------------------------------------------------  
WHAT IS AN AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE (AMI)?  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- An AMI is a template containing the software configuration to launch EC2 instances.  
- Includes an operating system, applications, and tools.  
- AMIs are mandatory for launching EC2 instances.  
- A single AMI can spawn one or multiple instances with identical configurations.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
AMIS COMPONENTS  
------------------------------------------------------------  
1. Storage  
   - Amazon EBS-backed AMIs: Contain snapshots of Amazon EBS volumes.  
   - Instance store-backed AMIs: Contain a template for the root volume.  
   - Examples: Operating system, applications, or application servers.  

2. Permissions  
   - Defines who can access and use the AMI.  

3. Mapping  
   - Determines how the AMI maps to instance storage and configurations.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
EC2 INSTANCE COMPONENTS  
------------------------------------------------------------  
1. Physical Hardware  
   - Includes compute, storage, and networking.  

2. Hypervisor  
   - Virtualization software that manages physical resources and allocates them to instances.  
   - Two types of hypervisors in AWS:  
     - Original Hypervisor  
     - AWS Nitro Hypervisor (part of the AWS Nitro System).  

3. AWS Nitro System  
   - A combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor.  
   - Optimizes instance performance and enhances security.  
   - Offloads management and I/O operations to dedicated hardware for better resource utilization.  
   - Nearly all server resources are delivered to instances, reducing costs and increasing performance.  

4. Elastic Network Interface  
   - Acts like a virtual network card for the instance.  
   - Allows instances to communicate with other resources, servers, or the internet.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
BARE-METAL INSTANCES  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- Bare-metal instances are physical servers without virtualization software (hypervisor).  
- Key Benefits:  
  - Direct access to hardware features.  
  - Ideal for workloads requiring nonvirtualized environments or specific licensing.  
  - Lowest latency due to absence of hypervisor overhead.  

- Use Cases:  
  - Deep performance analysis.  
  - Specialized workloads needing bare-metal access.  
  - Legacy applications or licensing-restricted Tier 1 apps.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- AMIs define the starting configuration for launching EC2 instances.  
- EC2 instances utilize physical hardware, virtualization (via hypervisor), and networking components.  
- AWS Nitro System enhances resource efficiency and performance.  
- Bare-metal instances offer direct hardware access with minimal latency.  


Amazon EC2 Instance Tenancy  

------------------------------------------------------------  
TENANCY OVERVIEW  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- Tenancy defines how EC2 instances are distributed across physical hardware in AWS.  
- It impacts pricing and availability.  
- There are three main tenancy options in EC2:  

1. Shared (Default)  
   - Multiple AWS accounts share the same physical hardware.  
   - The most economical choice.  
   - Supports Spot Instances and burstable instance types.  
   - Does not support Bring Your Own License (BYOL) models.  

2. Dedicated Instance  
   - Instances run on hardware dedicated to a single customer.  
   - Can share the hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not dedicated.  
   - Provides isolation but lacks visibility and control over instance placement.  

3. Dedicated Host  
   - Physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.  
   - Allows control over instance placement and visibility into the hardware.  
   - Suitable for organizations with compliance, security, or licensing requirements.  
   - Supports the BYOL model for certain software licenses.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
SHARED TENANCY  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- Default option for EC2 instances.  
- Instances run on shared hardware with other AWS customer accounts.  
- Instances are isolated and secured but share the underlying physical resources.  
- Suitable for cost-sensitive use cases but does not support BYOL.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
DEDICATED HOST  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- A physical server fully dedicated to a single AWS customer.  
- Useful for scenarios requiring compliance or licensing flexibility.  
- Provides visibility and control over instance placement.  
- Allows for use of per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses (BYOL).  
- Additional cost for renting the physical server.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
DEDICATED INSTANCES  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- Run on hardware dedicated to a single customer, but the hardware can be shared with other instances within the same AWS account.  
- Offers isolation but lacks control over hardware and instance placement.  
- The pricing consists of two components:  
  1. Hourly per-instance usage fee.  
  2. A dedicated per-Region fee (charged once per hour).  

------------------------------------------------------------  
KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEDICATED INSTANCES AND DEDICATED HOSTS  
------------------------------------------------------------  
| Characteristic                      | Dedicated Host       | Dedicated Instance      |  
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|  
| Supports dedicated physical servers | Yes                  | Yes                     |  
| Per-instance billing                | No                   | Yes                     |  
| Per-host billing                    | Yes                  | No                      |  
| Visibility of hardware resources    | Yes                  | No                      |  
| Affinity between host and instance  | Yes                  | No                      |  
| Bring Your Own License (BYOL)       | Yes                  | No                      |  
| Instance placement control          | Ye                   | No                      |  
| Automatic instance placement        | No                   | Yes                     |  

------------------------------------------------------------  
SUMMARY  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- Tenancy defines the allocation of EC2 instances to physical hardware.  
- Three types: Shared, Dedicated Instances, and Dedicated Hosts.  
- Dedicated Hosts offer greater control and visibility over the hardware, while Dedicated Instances provide some isolation without control
over placement.  
- Shared tenancy is the most economical but does not support BYOL.
