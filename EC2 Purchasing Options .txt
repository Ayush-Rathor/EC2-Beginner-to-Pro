EC2 Purchasing Options

Overview:
Amazon EC2 provides various purchasing options and savings plans that can help manage instance costs. These include On-Demand Instances, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, Dedicated Hosts, and Dedicated Instances.

Purchasing Options:
1. On-Demand Instances:
   - You pay full price by the second when you launch.
   - No long-term commitment is required.
   - Ideal for applications with unpredictable workloads or when you need to scale quickly.
   - Offers flexibility to start and stop instances at any time without upfront payment.

2. Savings Plans:
   - You commit to a certain amount of usage over a 1–3-year period.
   - In return for the commitment, you receive lower rates compared to On-Demand pricing.
   - Two types of savings plans:
     1. Compute Savings Plans: Applies to any EC2 instance regardless of region, instance family, operating system, or tenancy.
     2. EC2 Instance Savings Plans: Specific to a chosen instance family in a specific region, but offers more flexibility within that instance family.

3. Reserved Instances:
   - You agree to a specific instance configuration (instance type, size, and region) for a period of 1–3 years.
   - In return, you receive significant savings (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand prices.
   - Two types of Reserved Instances:
     1. Standard Reserved Instances: Provides the highest discount, but less flexibility. The instance type and configuration cannot be modified.
     2. Convertible Reserved Instances: Offers flexibility to change the instance family, operating system, or tenancy during the term.
   - Reserved Instances are ideal for steady-state workloads with predictable resource needs.

4. Spot Instances:
   - Spare EC2 compute capacity available at savings of up to 90% compared to On-Demand prices.
   - Spot Instances are ideal for workloads that are flexible and can tolerate interruptions.
   - The price is determined by market availability, and it fluctuates based on supply and demand.
   - You bid for the instance, and your Spot price is based on the maximum price you're willing to pay.
   - Spot Instances can be interrupted if there is a demand for the capacity.
   - Spot pricing is ideal for batch processing, data analysis, rendering, and other flexible workloads.
   - Spot Request Types:
     1. One-time Spot Instance Request: Stays active until fulfilled, expired, or canceled. The instance is terminated if the Spot price exceeds the maximum price or if capacity is unavailable.
     2. Persistent Spot Instance Request: Stays active even after fulfillment, allowing for automatic retries if the Spot Instance is interrupted.
     3. Spot Fleet: Allows you to manage a collection of Spot Instances across multiple instance types and availability zones.

5. Dedicated Hosts:
   - Dedicated Hosts are physical servers dedicated to your use.
   - Ideal for customers with specific compliance or licensing requirements.
   - You pay for the physical server, regardless of whether it is fully utilized.
   - Dedicated Hosts allow you to run instances that are physically isolated from other AWS customers.

6. Dedicated Instances:
   - Instances are placed on a single physical server, but there is no access to the underlying host.
   - Dedicated Instances provide physical isolation, but unlike Dedicated Hosts, AWS manages the underlying host and resources.
   - Dedicated Instances are billed by instance type and are isolated from other AWS customers at the hardware level.
   - Offers some level of isolation without requiring the entire host to be dedicated to a single customer.

Spot Instances Details:
- Spot Instances are available at lower prices compared to On-Demand Instances.
- Spot Instances can be interrupted with a two-minute warning if AWS needs the capacity back.
- Spot Instances are useful for applications that can handle interruptions, such as batch processing and big data workloads.
- To launch Spot Instances, you create a Spot Instance request specifying:
  - The number of instances.
  - Instance type.
  - Availability Zone.
  - Maximum price you’re willing to pay per hour per instance.

Ways to Request Spot Instances:
- Create a Spot Instance request via the EC2 console, CLI, or SDK.
- Use Spot Fleet to manage a collection of Spot Instances across different instance types and availability zones.
- Request Spot Instances using EC2 Auto Scaling to scale up or down based on demand.

AWS Pricing Tools:
- AWS Pricing Calculator: Helps estimate the cost of using various AWS services.
- Spot Instance Advisor: Helps choose the best Spot Instances based on pricing and availability trends.
- AWS Pricing: Detailed information on EC2 instance pricing and how to calculate costs for various purchasing options.

Summary of EC2 Pricing Options:
- On-Demand Instances: Full price, no commitment, ideal for unpredictable workloads.
- Savings Plans: Commit to usage for 1–3 years, flexible and cost-effective.
- Reserved Instances: Commit to a specific instance configuration for 1–3 years, great for steady-state workloads.
- Spot Instances: Bid on unused capacity, available at discounted prices, useful for flexible workloads.
- Dedicated Hosts: Full physical server dedicated to your use, ideal for compliance or licensing needs.
- Dedicated Instances: Instances on a single physical host with no access to the underlying host.
