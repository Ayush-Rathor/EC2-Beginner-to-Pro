AWS Global Infrastructure  

------------------------------------------------------------  
GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- AWS has deployed infrastructure in specific global locations with the highest demand for cloud services.  
- This allows John to potentially launch instances in multiple global locations.  
- The AWS Global Infrastructure page provides a map of available Regions and their corresponding Availability Zones (AZs).  

------------------------------------------------------------  
DEFINING AN AWS REGION  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- A Region is a geographic area with AWS physical infrastructure and data centers.  
- Each Region consists of multiple Availability Zones (AZs), which are isolated but connected by low-latency, high-bandwidth links.  
- AWS Regions are designed to provide high reliability and durability through redundancy.  
- Data in a Region stays within that Region, complying with local data sovereignty laws and compliance requirements.  
- Example: If data is stored in the Frankfurt Region, it stays in Frankfurt unless explicitly moved.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
SELECTING A REGION  
------------------------------------------------------------  
When choosing a Region, consider these four factors:  
1. Compliance with data governance and legal requirements  
2. Proximity to your customers  
3. Available services within the Region  
4. Pricing per Region  

------------------------------------------------------------  
AVAILABILITY ZONES  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- An Availability Zone (AZ) is a group of data centers within a Region.  
- AZs are tens of miles apart to minimize the risk of multiple zones being affected by a disaster.  
- Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and physical security.  
- Applications requiring high availability can use multiple AZs for fault tolerance and redundancy.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD (VPC)  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- A VPC is a private virtual network dedicated to an AWS account, logically isolated from others.  
- Within the VPC, you can launch AWS resources like EC2 instances in subnets.  
- VPCs are software-based and do not map directly to physical infrastructure.  
- A VPC provides complete control over routing, security, and services running within it.  
- Example: Each apartment in an apartment building has its own private network and security controls.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
VPC TYPES  
------------------------------------------------------------  
1. Default VPC  
   - Automatically created in each AWS Region.  
   - Includes a public subnet in each AZ and an internet gateway.  
   - Suitable for quickly launching EC2 instances and basic applications.  
   - Can be modified to fit specific needs.  

2. Nondefault VPC  
   - Created manually within an AWS account.  
   - Isolated by default, with no inbound or outbound access unless explicitly configured.  
   - Can have default or dedicated tenancy options.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
AWS NETWORKING  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- AWS networking provides flexibility with services for routing and security, differing slightly from traditional data center networking.  
- John reviews topics like TCP/IP subnetting and CIDR notation.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
SUBNETS  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- A subnet is a smaller network inside a larger network, providing efficiency by reducing the distance data must travel.  
- Subnets are contained within a single Availability Zone.  
- Public subnets are used for internet-facing resources, while private subnets are for internal resources.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
SUBNETTING DETAILS  
------------------------------------------------------------  
- Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller sections. This is done by borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address.  
- A subnet mask is a 32-bit address used to separate the network portion from the host portion of an IP address.  
- The subnet mask for a network determines how many bits are used for the network and how many are used for the host.  
- Example of an IP address 10.0.1.4/24:  
  - The network is 10.0.1.x and .4 is the host.  
  - The subnet mask is /24 (255.255.255.0), which means the first 24 bits are for the network.  

- Example of an IP address 10.0.1.4/16:  
  - The network portion is 10.0, and the host portion is .1.4.  
  - The subnet mask is /16 (255.255.0.0), meaning the first 16 bits are for the network.  

- Example of an IP address 10.0.1.4/26:  
  - The network portion is 10.0.1, and the host portion is .4 (or any number between .1 and .64).  
  - The subnet mask is /26 (255.255.255.192), meaning the first 26 bits are for the network.  

------------------------------------------------------------  
KEY NETWORKING COMPONENTS  
------------------------------------------------------------  
1. CIDR Blocks: A range of IP addresses for VPCs, typically in IPv4, with optional support for IPv6.  
2. Subnetting: Dividing the CIDR block into smaller networks (subnets).  
3. Reserved IPs: Five IP addresses in each subnet are reserved for AWS use.  
4. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs): Stateless filtering for network traffic to/from subnets.  
5. Security Groups: Stateful firewalls that control traffic to/from instances within subnets.
