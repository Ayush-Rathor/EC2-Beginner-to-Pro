Network Options - Notes
---------------------------

Overview:
- Elastic network interfaces (ENI) are logical network components that represent a virtual network card.
- ENIs enable EC2 instances to communicate with other hosts, resources, and the internet.
- Security groups are associated with the elastic network interface and control the allowed inbound traffic.

---------------------------
Elastic Network Interfaces
---------------------------
- Two types of elastic network interfaces:
  1. **Primary ENI**: Created by default when the instance is launched. It cannot be detached or moved from the instance.
  2. **Secondary ENI**: An additional interface that can be attached to an instance. Multiple secondary ENIs can be used depending on the instance type.
- You can move a secondary ENI from one instance to another. The network traffic is automatically redirected to the new instance.

---------------------------
Attributes of an Elastic Network Interface
---------------------------
- Primary private IPv4 address (from the VPC’s IPv4 range)
- Secondary private IPv4 addresses
- One Elastic IP address (IPv4) per private IPv4 address
- One public IPv4 address
- One or more IPv6 addresses
- One or more security groups
- MAC address
- Source/destination check flag
- Description

---------------------------
Use Cases for Elastic Network Interfaces
---------------------------
1. **Failover**: 
   - Detach the ENI from a failed instance and attach it to a new instance. This preserves the original IP address, and traffic automatically routes to the new instance.
2. **Management**: 
   - Use multiple ENIs for separating traffic. One ENI can be used for administrative traffic and another for workload/business traffic. Security groups can isolate traffic based on port, protocol, or IP address.

---------------------------
Public IP Address
---------------------------
- Instances automatically receive a public IP address when started. This IP is used for external internet connections.
- When the instance is stopped, the public IP address is released and not reassigned unless the instance is restarted.
- The behavior of public IP address assignment differs between default and nondefault VPCs:
  - In a default VPC: A public IP is assigned automatically.
  - In a nondefault VPC: Public IP assignment depends on subnet settings. By default, instances in nondefault subnets do not receive a public IP.

---------------------------
Public IP Address Pool Assignments
---------------------------
- Public IPs are assigned from a pool of Amazon's public IPv4 addresses.
- When disassociated from an instance, the public IP is returned to the public IPv4 pool, and it cannot be reused.
- You cannot manually associate or disassociate a public IP (IPv4) address from an instance.

---------------------------
Public IP Address Release and Reassignment
---------------------------
- The instance's public IP is released when:
  1. The instance is stopped.
  2. The instance is terminated.
- If a persistent public IP is needed, use Elastic IP.

---------------------------
Elastic IP Address
---------------------------
- Elastic IP (EIP) is a static public IPv4 address associated with your AWS account.
- EIP persists after stopping and starting the instance, unlike an auto-assigned public IP.
- You can associate an EIP with an EC2 instance via:
  - Amazon EC2 Console
  - AWS CLI
  - AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell
- Points to remember:
  - Cannot retain or convert an auto-assigned public IP to an EIP.
  - Maximum limit: 5 Elastic IPs per Region per AWS account.
  - Small charge for unused Elastic IPs that are not associated with a running instance.

---------------------------
Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)
---------------------------
- You can bring part or all of your publicly routable IPv4 or IPv6 address range from your on-premises network to your AWS account.
- After bringing the address range to AWS, it is managed as an address pool in your account.
- AWS advertises your IP range on the internet by default.

---------------------------
IPv6 Address
---------------------------
- Optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets.
- IPv6 CIDR blocks are automatically assigned from Amazon’s pool. You cannot choose the range yourself.
- Currently, you cannot remove the default IPv4 address and use only IPv6.
